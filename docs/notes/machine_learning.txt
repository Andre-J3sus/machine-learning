Machine Learning:
 - method of data analysis
 - automates analytical model building
 - branch of artificial intelligence
 - identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention

Model and Testing:
 - in machine learning, we create a model and try to predict the test data
 - training data -> used to fit the model
 - testing data  -> used to test the model
