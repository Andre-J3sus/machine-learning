Machine Learning:
 - method of data analysis
 - automates analytical model building
 - branch of artificial intelligence
 - identify patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention

Some algorithms:
 - Linear Regression
 - Logistic Regression
 - Decision Tree
 - K-Nearest Neighbors
 - Support Vector Machine
 - Naive Bayes Algorithm
 - K-Means
 - Random Forest Algorithm


Model and Testing:
 - in machine learning, we create a model and try to predict the test data
 - training data -> used to fit the model
 - testing data  -> used to test the model


Linear Regression Algorithm:
 - model the relationship between two variables
 by fitting a linear equation to observed data
 - linear regression line equation: y = a + bx:
    - x: explanatory variable
    - y: dependent variable
    - a: slope of the line (how much the y value increases for each x value)
    - b: intercept (the value of y when x = 0)


K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
 - used for classifying data (in small data sets)
 - classify data into certain categories
 - works by looking at the K-closest points to the given data point
 (the one we want to classify) and picking the class that occurs the
 most to be the predicted value
 - computationally heavy: requires the entire data set to make a prediction
 - high memory usage: requires that the entire data set be loaded into memory to perform a prediction
 - K must be an odd number to prevent draws
